## 📝 Project Description

**GreenHub** is a dynamic gardening community and resource platform built with:
-  **React**, **React Router**, **Firebase**, **TailwindCSS**, and **DaisyUI** on the frontend.
-  **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB** on the backend.

The goal is to connect gardening enthusiasts, promote sustainable green practices, and create a space where people can learn from each other and grow their own mini green world — whether on a rooftop, balcony, or backyard.
